Configuration options / notes
-------------
GST
If you are registered for GST please set the appropriate tax class for your particular setup.  
This does not affect the *quotations* in any way, but it does affect the GST is processed in calculations/reports, etc  

Dimensions
Please set some *default* dimensions for the parcels that you will be mailing out. These dimensions are used
when there are no dimensions found for a specific product.  It is not possible to quote an item with no dimensions. 
Note: Dimensions are in centimeters.

Weights: 
The 'default' weight setting is used where the individual products don't have their own weight applied. 
Setting this to zero will allow special actions to be taken if the products weights are also zero (such as triggering an alert, 
or eliminated the item from the shipping calculations).  

COD
Although this module offers COD as a _shipping method_, if you wish to use it, you will also need 
to install/activate the COD _payment_ module, available from www.zen-cart.com  (but DON'T assign any fees or charges to it).
This apparent duplication is required because after selecting a shipping method (in this case COD), the next screen 
presented is the payment options (along with provision for gift voucher and coupon redemptions). Without a 
COD option on this screen too, a COD paying customer will never be able to check-out.  

DEBUG 
If enabled this module will echo a considerable amount of debugging information to the screen. You'll find this very useful if
things aren't working correctly. It is also invaluable if you wish to see how multiple items are being packed/stacked. 

Admin section: 
The products database will have 4 new fields added (length, height, width & dangerous_goods) when you install this module. 
These fields are NOT removed if you uninstall this module. 
No harm is done by leaving them intact, and if you did enter data into these fields you probably wouldn't want them removed anyway.   

Dimensions for individual products are an over-ride of the default dimensions (see above), 
they can be added or edited via the usual admin interface.     

Dangerous Goods: 
Dangerous Goods can't be Air mailed, and not all Couriers will take them.
Setting this to Yes prevents these methods from being supplied if this product as added to the customers cart. 
                                 
ALLOW and HIDE explained.
To gain maximum benefit from the ozpost module/server it will help if you understand how it works, especially in
regards as to why we allow some methods yet wish to hide them at the same time.

The way it works is this:
After the 'parcel' has been created by the client (your store), it sends the parcel weights, dimensions, and a few other
details to our server.  The server then returns a list of shipping methods that are POSSIBLE for that particular parcel,
if it is a small item, it may be possible to send it as a letter, it may also be sent in a
prepaid satchel, or it may need to go as a parcel of some type.. all of these *possible* methods are returned
to your store where they are compared with the methods that you *allow*, and if there is a match, the
method is shown to the customer.  No match = no show, so by DE-SELECTING (or leaving de-selected) a method
means that it will never be displayed under any circumstances. IOW, you are selecting the methods you wish to ALLOW.

Now, suppose your 'parcel' is small enough to be considered a large letter, as mentioned above, the server will
return all the *possible* methods, but more often than not, if an item can be sent as a letter it would be silly to
showing the satchel and/or parcel rates, so by setting the 'hide parcel rates if letter sized' causes the SERVER to
*only* return the letter rates, and nothing larger...   likewise, by setting the 'hide parcel rates if satchel sized'
will cause the SERVER to only return the satchel rates and not the parcel rates, setting the 'hide courier if Australia Post can handle it
will ensure that the courier quotes won't show if AP can handle it.
By combining these allow/hide features you can support over 50 different shipping methods while providing your
customer only 2 or 3 choices at any given time.

Note: If quotes fail to show when expected it is often because a legitimate method (such as letters) has been disallowed, and all other methods
have been 'hidden'. Under this condition the module falls back to the static rates, which is usually NOT what you want.
 
Use Core Weight:
Under 'normal conditions', the shopping cart core code calculates the number of
parcels needed, and their weights, based on the settings in the
shipping/packing configuration. It then makes this information available to
the shipping module(s).
This isn't/wasn't really suitable for my (our?) needs, where the total weight
and volume is more important  than the number of calculated parcels and the
average weight, so up until recently (V2.0.8)  ozpost ignored the zencart
supplied values and calculated its own (the main end difference being with
the tare weight values, which many found troublesome anyway).

The "Use Core Weight" setting is giving back the ability to use the shopping cart
supplied values, which also includes the creation of multiple parcels based
on weight. The ozpost method assumes a single parcel only, regardless of
weight.

Restrain Dimensions options.
The "Restrain Dimensions" option will limit the dimensions of any given parcel
being quoted so that it will never fail a quote due to its size alone, for
example, the max length item that Australia Post will accept is 105cm - so if
the ozpost module calculates the parcel as being (say) 120cm long (which
would normally fail to produce a quote), it will instead provide a quote for
an item only 105cm long ... IOW, it will be quoted BASED ON WEIGHT ONLY.

Up until the maximums are reached the dimensions are treated in their usual
manner, with this option enabled, adding more items to the cart will increase
the weight of the parcel without increasing its size any further.

Update Method: 
Setting this to 'Auto' (default) will cause the module to update itself as new releases become available. 
Set to manual you will be notified of updates but they will not be downloaded or installed.   

Remove button Action
When set to 'complete removal' the module will delete all of its database entries and if you re-install you will also need to re-configure all of your settings. 
When set to 'Upgrade' the 'Remove' button will create a backup of your current settings before removing itself. If you re-install (or manually upgrade) your settings will be restored (any new settings will be set at default values) 

Leadtime/ Deadline  
These are used in conjuction with each other to allow you to fine tune for next day deliveries ...  or not... 

If you wish to offer NEXT DAY delivery to your customers you need to post your items on the SAME day that it is ordered (obviously?). 
The Deadline is used to determine the cutoff time that you will accept same day mail orders. Typically 10am - midday.  This will also cater for 
orders received overnight, as well as those that missed the previous days deadline.  

If you set the LEADTIME to anything other than zero you are telling the module that no matter what time the order comes in TODAY it won't 
be *mailed* until 'x' days have passed. 1 day = Tomorrow.    
However, the DEADLINE is still taken into consideration, so if the order arrives after the deadline this will add another delay 
meaning the 'next day' delivery may not even 'start' until 2 days after the order was placed.  That's the one day leadtime before
you can post, plus another because they have missed the deadline for that days order processing.    

None of this affects the actual quote of course, but it is good customer relations that if they order next day delivery before your 
deadline they should actually expect a next day delivery, and the module should accurately report this fact. 
In contrast, if you set a 1 day leadtime, and a deadline of (say) 1pm, and the customer orders on Thursday AM hoping for Friday delivery 
they could be quite upset to find their overnight delivery won't arrive until the following Monday (the module will show this, if set 
to do so of course, but is it what you *really* want?    

If you don't wish to offer overnight deliveries (same day mailings) it is better to set a Deadline of (say) "0"  (midnight) so that all 
orders received that 'day' are already too late for same day mailing, but will be suitable to mail the following day. This way any
order received at any time on 'thursday' will be estimated using a mailing day of friday (unless you don't mail on Fridays).  

The processing order is this: 
1.  If current time is later than the deadline time then item will be mailed 'tomorrow', else it will be mailed 'today' 
2.  If Leadtime > 0  then the item will be mailed today/tomorrow + Leadtime days.  
3.  If mail day (today/tomorrow + Leadtime days) falls on a weekend, holiday or a day that you have indicated you 
    don't mail then the day is incremented one day at a time until a suitable mailday is found.        
4   The estimated delivery days are then retrieved from the various servers, added to the actual mail day, and the expected 
    delivery day/date is presented.   

You can significantly increase sales by offering (and providing) a next day delivery service. However, accurate 
delivery estimates are essential if you do offer such a service. 
     

Customising: 
The following defines are examples of how to override the default *descriptions* of the various shipping methods. This is useful if you wish to obfuscate identifying any particular carrier based on this information.

The  examples listed are used to prevent the EGO methods from being displayed as "EGO EGO Parcel"  &  "EGO EGO Insured Parcel"
It does this by simply changing "EGO Parcel to just "Parcel".

The *carrier* names are defined in the /languages/../ozpost.php file.

If you wish to change the example defines, and/or add you own you should copy them into the /languages/...../ozpost.php file so as to avoid your changes being overwritten with the next update.

To add/use/create your own overrides you will first need to identify the methodID code then append "_description" to this code (as per examples).
You should be able identify the methodID's by looking at the 'case' commands midway in the code /includes/modules/shipping/ozpost.php (about half way in).

define('EGOi_description', 'Insured Parcel') ;
define('EGO_description' , 'Parcel') ;
define('TRD_description' , 'Parcel') ;
define('RPP_description' , 'OzPost Regular Parcel Post') ;
define('FWS_description' , 'SlowWay bags') ;       // Fastway Satchel override
define('FWL_description' , 'SlowWay prepaid') ;    // Fastway label override

etc, etc... There are over sixty of them. Most you won't need to change.


Click and Send 
V3.2.0  has added functionality for Click n Send CSV data export suitable for importing into the click n send website 
You can enable this functionality via the ozpost config settings. Once enabled, whenever *any* Austrlalia post shipping method 
is selected by your customer the CSV file is created if it doesn't exist, and if it does exist the new data is appended
to the existing data  
Whenever a CVS data file exists you will find two new options under the 'customers' menu. The first option will let you 
download the data file, the second option will allow you to delete the data file. In order to avoid duplicate imports the data 
file should be deleted after each succesfull download. 
This data file will contain all possible fields needed for a successful import, but please be aware that due to the
way the click n send importer works you will need to set the shipping method chosen by your customer after the import has been performed. 
The primary purpose of this code is to minimise the amount of manual data entry required to create the shipping labels, etc 

Although the click n send is supposed to work in conjunction with the 'ebay' type packaging, it doesn't. 
This is a conversation I had with the click n send support people. 
Me: 
----------------------------------------------------------- 
Hi, 

I'm trying to adapt some software that will create a CSV file suitable
to use with the click n send data importer. 

I have read the whitepaers, etc, and am creating what appears to be
valid data files. However, I am having an issue trying to get the system
to recognise any valid service codes for the 'ebay' satchels and/or
boxes. 

Are these not supported by the click n send system (The only ones
documented are 1 ECI, 2 EPI, 3 RPI, 4 Air, 5 Parcel <500gm, 6 Parcel,
7 Express < 500gm, 8 Express, 9 Plat < 500, 10 Plat.

Is there an update to these service codes? 

What does the CSV file require to recognise these package types? 

--------------------------------------------------
Their reply: 

Thank you for your Click and Send enquiry.

The flat rate postage products are currently unable to be included in a CSV 
file import.  These products require a product code to be entered into a 
transaction to access the flat rate of postage, there is currently no 
provision to enter this into the CSV file. 

-----------------------------------------------
My response: 

Thanks for the reply.  

   Are their other methods or another API that does allow this? 
What does the eBay inregration use? 

Thanks,
Rod

-----------------------------------------
Their reply: 

Dear Rod,

There are currently no other alternatives for importing flat-rate
products. These would be required to be entered manually.
