Version 4.2.8
=============

Upgrading from an older version of ozpost will require that
you replace the following two files 

/includes/modules/shipping/ozpost.php     (always) 
/includes/languages/english/modules/shipping/ozpost.php. (only if new couriers have been added) 

No new installations are available.
===================================
For a new installation log into the store admin panel and navigate to modules->shipping. 
Select the 'Ozpost Multiquote' module and click the 'Install' button.

Configure for your needs. 
   
If upgrading from an earlier version, check that the option 'Remove button Action' is set to 'Upgrade'  
Click the button(s) to 'Remove' the module, then press the 'Install' button to complete the upgrade/ 

Although most settings are retained during an upgrade you should *ALWAYS* log in as admin and check them.

If things don't appear to function correctly after an upgrade please try doing another 'remove/install' 
procedure from your control panel before seeking advice.
