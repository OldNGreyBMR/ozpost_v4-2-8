Although all care has been taken to ensure that all quotes a 'valid' there are times where you'll
find that things just aren't right.  

The most common cause for invalid quotes is because the 'kilos/grams' setting is incorrect.
  
    Although zen-cart appears to use 'lbs' as its default weight, this is little more 
    than a 'display' value. The actual weight is basically a number of 'units'.  EG, 
    if you set an items weight as "10", this could be 10lbs, 10gms, or 10kgs.  
    
    The ozpost module assumes your weights are either grams or kilos (not lbs), but it
    is up to you to specify the correct option when you configure the module.
    
    Tip: If you haven't entered any product data yet, use the following rule of thumb: 
	If *most* of your products weight 1kg or more, use 'kilos'.  
	If *most* of your products weight less than 1kg, use 'grams'.  
	
	If you have already entered product weight data then choose the setting that matches the data you have input. 
	  
    Whatever you elect to use KEEP YOUR WEIGHTS CONSISTANT.  Don't try to use grams for some items, and 
    kilos for others because it isn't going to work correctly. 
    
    Almost any invalid quote can usually be identified by temporarily enabling the 'debug' option 
    to see exactly what data is being sent to the servers. 

Tip: The ozpost installation code will update the languages/english file to reflect the weight format defined
in the ozpost module. If you change this setting you should then perform the 'remove' and 'install' keypresses 
to ensure this file is kept up to date.
